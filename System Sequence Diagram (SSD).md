## System Sequence Diagram (SSD)
---------------------
1. Students view the courses they can take, save the selected courses as drafts
2. Students with tuition debts pay their debts. (This is an alternate step)
3. If there is no conflict in the selected courses, the student sends the selected courses to the advisor's approval.
4. The advisor checks the courses chosen by the student.
5. The advisor approves the selected courses.
