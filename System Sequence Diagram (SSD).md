## System Sequence Diagram (SSD)
---------------------
1. Students view the lectures they can take, save the selected lectures as drafts
2. Students with tuition debts pay their debts. (This is an alternate step)
3. If there is no conflict in the selected lectures, the student sends the selected lectures to the advisor's approval.
4. The advisor checks the lectures chosen by the student.
5. The advisor approves the selected lectures.
