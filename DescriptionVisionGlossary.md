1-) Description
This student registration system is the need of all universities like our university. Unless this registration system design exists , it would be exactly harder to carry out process of taking lectures for students.On the other side, there may be many problems while taking lectures by students such as lecture quota,prerequisite courses,collision. 

In order to avoid these problems , we design this software which simulates registration of courses . Basically , student takes courses by using registration system from their cirriculum and advisor observes their requests by taking care of problems mentioned above.

3-) Vision 
In the first iteration , our vision is to desing and implement simulation of student lecture registration which is used by our department.It will be designed by depending on department rules and regulations for taking lecture. In developing our system , simulation will take input file and arguments such as student,lecture and simulation runs .
